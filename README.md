# 👋 Hi, I'm Vlad!

I’m a **front-end developer** transitioning from a background in teaching **Ballroom Dances**. My journey into programming started as a change of career path and as a challenge debugging and understanding how things actually works as for building **interactive** and **user-friendly** web experiences.  

I completed my studies at the [Baltic Technology Institute](https://bit.lt/), where I gained practical experience by crafting **responsive and dynamic web applications**.

As my path in the tech world begins to open up, I’m realizing more and more how much there is to learn - concepts, tools, and the valuable experience gained from different projects. It’s both inspiring and challenging.
